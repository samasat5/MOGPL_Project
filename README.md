During the MOGPL course in M1 S1, we explored different scenarios of total uncertainty, where evaluations depend on multiple possible outcomes. Key objectives include solving problems like the knapsack problem and robust pathfinding using criteria such as maxmin, minmax regret, and OWA-based approaches. Linear programming models are implemented in Python with Gurobi to identify solutions that perform well across all scenarios. The project aims to balance performance and robustness while exploring computational efficiency.
